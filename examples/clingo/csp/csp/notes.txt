- changed print, main, init functions, options and theory ->
  one project with options to switch? Several projects?
- theory atoms were unreachable so I had to copy them
    Best way to pass them? When are they unreachable?
- Had unsat when syntactically identical constraints with different literals were added 
    -> had to check for duplicates
- fixed undefined to -max_int as 0 is often used -> still problems in combination with domain statements (even with fix above)
- How to best adapt test environment?
